                An Ode to the Sunseekers is an editorial journey through artist Tyler, the Creator's career as a 
                fashion designer and musician. The project is formatted in such a way that the artist becomes a passenger 
                of the flight that is his own career, treating the book as his travel scrapbook, 
                with several stops that represent each of his major fashion brands and milestones.<br><br>

                The foremost stage of the experience is its packaging, which emulates Golf le Fleur*'s Globe-trotter 
                suitcases. Inside can be found a hand-sewn book (Tyler's scrapbook) as well as a small stamp that the reader will be able to use at 
                the end of the book, to mark their participation in the journey. It also includes a QR code to 
                an interactive catalogue of some of le Fleur*'s products, as well as an AR depiction of the brand's pop-up shop.
