                Desution is an IT consulting startup that provides an array of technological services to clients worldwide. 
                Our task was to create their entire website from scratch along with an in-built web app that served a specific function. 
                I lead the backend side of the project, specifically creating the admin side of the web app: a dashboard 
                Desution admins can log into to add the company's clients and their projects, and update them on their progress. 
                Aside from frontend languages, I used PHP and mySql along with phpMyAdmin for database creation.

            <p>The admin-side of the app is built like a dashboard, where admins can add clients to the databases and 
                manage their projects, adding new phases and sending different attachments to show the project's progress.
